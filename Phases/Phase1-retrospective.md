### PHASE1_RETROSPECTIVE.md

**Project Banyan – Phase 1**

**What was harder than expected?**
Resisting premature generalization. The urge to make things configurable and extensible appeared constantly, even when explicitly forbidden.

**Where did I overthink?**
I initially overthought AST as a concept instead of trusting a minimal execution model and letting understanding emerge from implementation.

**Where did discipline help?**
Strict constraints on scope, packages, and class responsibilities prevented architectural drift and forced clean boundaries.

**What surprised me?**
How small the execution core actually is when responsibilities are well-defined. Most complexity is optional, not fundamental.

**What I will do differently in Phase 2?**
I will define semantic constraints and evolution rules earlier, instead of focusing primarily on structure and execution.
